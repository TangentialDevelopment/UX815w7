    <p>Next, I hopped through a wormhole and landed in a dimension where the dominant life form was giant, philosophical space crabs. They spent their days debating the meaning of existence while cracking open black holes like they were walnuts. (Side note: Black hole shells are delicious. Tastes like existential dread with a hint of cinnamon.)</p>
    <p>I whipped out my towel to sit on during one of their debates, and the crabs went nuts. Turns out, towels are considered sacred in their culture. They thought I was a prophet sent by the Great Claw in the Sky. I didn’t correct them. Instead, I led a meditation session called “Towel Enlightenment,” where we all chanted, “Wash, dry, repeat.”</p>
    <p>Lesson learned: A towel can make you a spiritual leader. Use this power wisely.</p>
